##  Project Overview
This project is a simple calculator implemented in C. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator takes user input, processes the operation, and returns the result.

## ðŸš€ Installation & Compilation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/georgiassc/calculator.git
   cd calculator
   ```
2. Compile the project using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc calculator
   ```
3. Run the calculator:
   ```sh
   ./a.out
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first number.
3. Enter the second number.
4. Choose the operation: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, or `div`.
5. The result will be displayed.

Example:
```
What is the first number? 5
What is the second number? 3
What kind of calculator do you want to make? (Write 'add' for addition, 'sub' for subtraction, 'div' for division, or 'mul' for multiplication.) add
The answer is:
8
```

## Future Improvements
- Handle division by zero cases properly
- Implement error handling for buffer overflow on input
- Allow multiple operations in a single expression
- Implement advanced mathematical functions
